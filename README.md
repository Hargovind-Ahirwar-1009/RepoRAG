# üìö RepoRAG: AI-Powered Codebase Q&A

**RepoRAG** is an intelligent assistant that lets you **chat with any public GitHub repository**.  
It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to analyze source code and documentation,  
allowing you to ask complex questions and get accurate, context-aware answers.

> This project was built as a learning exercise to explore applying RAG to the unique challenges of understanding software projects.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **GitHub Repository Ingestion** ‚Äì Analyze any public GitHub repo by simply providing its URL.  
- **Multi-Language Code Understanding** ‚Äì Intelligently chunks code by functions and classes for languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, and more.  
- **Hybrid Search** ‚Äì Combines semantic and keyword search for highly relevant results.  
- **Flexible Backends** ‚Äì Supports both free, local embedding models and high-performance OpenAI models via API.  
- **Interactive UI** ‚Äì Clean and simple web interface built with Streamlit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Clone & Parse** ‚Äì RepoRAG clones the target repository.  
2. **Chunk & Embed** ‚Äì Splits code & docs into logical chunks, converts them into vector embeddings using ChromaDB.  
3. **Retrieve & Answer** ‚Äì Retrieves the most relevant chunks for your query and passes them as context to a Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4o, Llama 3) to generate precise answers.
